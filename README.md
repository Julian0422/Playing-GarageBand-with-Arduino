Hi guys, I built an 88-key piano using a Raspberry Pi Pico in a previous series. However, even though I added filters and amps, the sound was still too Midi. Therefore, I came up with an idea why I can’t use some extended software like GarageBand to output the sound and make it better. Then, let’s try it out!

If you are a music or Apple lover, I believe that you must hear GarageBand before. If this is the first time you hear this name, it doesn't matter. According to the Apple webpage, the claim that GarageBand is a fully equipped music creation studio right inside your Mac. Being a music amateur, I also agree that GarageBand is an excellent music software, and the most significant advantage is that it is free software. Hence, in this share, I will take it as an example to share how to play GarageBand with Arduino.

If you tried to make a keyboard using Arduino, you might face that the Arduino Uno can't use the Keyboard.h library. For that library, it only allows the 32u4 and SAMD-based boards (Leonardo, Esplora, Zero, Due, and MKR Family) to appear as a native Keyboard to a connected computer. Hence, this time, I used Arduino Nano 33 IOT to do this project, which used the SAMD21 Cortex®-M0+ 32bit low power ARM MCU.
